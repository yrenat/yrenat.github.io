PRE REQ:

1. Windows 11 Home Edition & WSL2 Linux Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS

2. PostgreSQL & PGAdmin already installed in Windows OS, and PostgreSQL installed in     Linux OS (further config is not required, only basic installation commands are needed)

ERRORS: 

1. 

command input: 

psql -U postgres
error generated:

psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user "postgres"
possible causes:

(1). System username and PostgreSQL database username are seperated and stored in seperate doamains, where WSL is defaulted to load current username while database username is set default to be "postgres"

(2). PostgreSQL authentication is wrongly set and current user has no access to wanted database

feasible solutions (one-to-one):

(1). 

sudo -u postgres psql
sudo command with -u flag forces psql to run with username "postgres"

(2).

cd to pg_hba.conf, which normally locates in:

/etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_ident.conf
change this line:

local   all             all                                     peer
into:

local   all             all                                     md5
or:

local   all             all                                     all
where md5/all grants access to all users.
